# Live Monitoring

## Monitor GPU Metrics
A default option that can be switched off.

```sh
Current GPU Metrics (Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB) as of 2024-09-12 16:53:14:

## Monitor Benchmark Container/Tmux Logs
  
```sh
gpu_monitor --benchmark-image "synthetic_regression" --monitor-logs

For this reason, `logger=True` will use `CSVLogger` as the default logger, unless the `tensorboard` or `tensorboardX` packages are found.

Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=11` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.

(Long container logs containing "\r" to clear the line for progress bars are not a very efficiently processed, as it captures a snapshot of the entire container log at that moment.
Potiential solution: use asynico package to capture and process the logs whilst the monitor is paused between intervals)

## (Save png) Timeseries Plot Live

Gives you saves plot png during every reading so that the metrics can be viewed live **locally**.

**Example command and Results:**
```sh
gpu_monitor --benchmark-image "stemdl_classification_2gpu" --plot_live
```
This command was run on a VM with 2 V100 GPUs for the results in [Collecting Results Section](collecting_results.md#gpu-metrics-timeseries-plot-png).


## (Grafana) Timeseries Plot Live

If the `--export-to-meerkat` tag is used the results can be viewed live from the Grafana Dashboard. Data from multiple VMs can be collected all at once allowing for a live comparison of performance as well.

See example results [Collecting Results Section](collecting_results.md#gpu-metric-grafana-plots).
